## Creating A New Level

To create a new level, we want to create a scene from our `level.tscn` file. To do this, select the following from the Godot menu:

`Scene` -> `New Inherited Scene...`

Then select `level.tscn` from the `res://levels/` directory.

This will setup a new level with the proper TileMap, Player, and container Nodes for Boxes and Goals that you need to create the level. It will also use the parent script which will handle the level logic for you. This will just save some time creating new levels as you have a template to follow.
